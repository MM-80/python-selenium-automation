     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<i>
    <ul>

    <li>1 small butternut squash, cubed</li>
    <li>2 red bell peppers, seeded and diced</li>
    <li>1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>3 Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed</li>
    <li>1 red onion, quartered</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

    </ul>

           <h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>

           <li>Heat the oven to <b>425°F</b>. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to <b>425°F</b>. Meanwhile, prep the vegetables.</li>
           <li>Chop up the vegetables. Peel the vegetables if desired, then cut into uniform pieces so they cook evenly. Smaller pieces will cook more quickly; larger pieces will take a bit longer to cook. If your vegetables still have some moisture after washing, be sure to pat them as dry as possible; the drier the vegetable, the better it will roast.</li>
           <li>Toss the vegetables with olive oil and season. Transfer the vegetables to a large bowl. Add the oil, salt, and pepper and toss to combine. Add more oil if the vegetables still look dry or don't seem evenly coated</li>
           <li>Spread onto a baking sheet. Spread the vegetables out on a rimmed baking sheet, in an oven-proof skillet, or in a baking dish. Make sure they are in a single layer with a little space in between. If they are too crowded, the vegetables will steam instead of roast -- use 2 baking sheets if needed instead</li>
    <li>Estimate your cooking time. In general, softer vegetables, like green beans and cauliflower, will cook in <b>10 to 20 minutes</b>, and tough, hard vegetables, like winter squash and potatoes, will take <b>30 minutes</b> or longer. Large pieces will also take longer to cook than smaller pieces.</li>
    <li>Roast the vegetables until tender. Place the vegetables in the oven and begin roasting. Check and stir the vegetables every <b>10 to 15 minutes</b>. Continue roasting until the vegetables are easily pierced with a fork or knife and they are showing crispy, charred bits at the tips and edges.</li>
           <li>Serve. Transfer the vegetables to a serving dish and taste; sprinkle with more salt or pepper if needed.
</li>
