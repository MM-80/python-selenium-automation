Below The Arithmetical Mean
When given a list, the program should return a list of all the elements below the original listâ€™s arithmetical mean.
The arithmetical mean is the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
Example: [1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 2, 3] (The arithmetical mean is 4.25), Return [1, 3, 4, 2, 3]

Two Lowest Elements
When given a list of elements, find the two lowest elements.
They can be equal to each other or different.
Example: [198, 3, 4, 9, 10, 9, 2], Return: 2, 3
